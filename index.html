        <h1>Hello, I'm [Your Name]</h1>
        <p>I am a Computer Science graduate with a growing interest in web development and creative problem solving. Although my degree focused on computing, I’ve recently discovered my passion for designing and building websites.</p>
        <p>I am applying for this program because I want to improve my technical skills, especially in JavaScript, and gain practical experience through real projects. I’m eager to learn in a structured environment and connect with other aspiring developers.</p>
